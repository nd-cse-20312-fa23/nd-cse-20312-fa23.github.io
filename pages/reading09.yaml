  **Everyone**:

  Next week, we will begin exploring [binary trees] and focus on how to
  **represent** them, how to **traverse** them, and how to use
  [divide-and-conquer] to solve programming challenges involving [binary
  trees].  Additionally, we will spend some time on [generators] in [Python]
  and how they can be used to process [binary trees] efficiently.

      $ git pull --rebase                   # Make sure we are up-to-date with GitHub

      $ git checkout -b reading09           # Create reading09 branch and check it out

      $ cd reading09                        # Go into reading09 folder
      $ $EDITOR answers.json                # Edit your answers.json file

      $ ../.scripts/check.py                # Check reading09 quiz
