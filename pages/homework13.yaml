  The goal of this homework assignment is to allow you explore three different
  [algorithms] that work on [graphs]: [Dijkstra's Algorithm], [Prim's Algorithm],
  [Kahn's Algorithm].  You will need to implement each of these [algorithms] to
  solve **three programming challenges**, described below.

  For this assignment, you are to do your work in the `homework13` folder of
  your **assignments** [GitHub] repository and push your work by **noon,
  Wednesday, December 6**.

  ## Activity 0: Preparation

  Before starting this homework assignment, you should first perform a `git
  pull` to retrieve any changes in your remote [GitHub] repository:

      :::bash
      $ cd path/to/repository                   # Go to assignments repository

      $ git switch master                       # Make sure we are in master branch

      $ git pull --rebase                       # Get any remote changes not present locally

  Next, create a new branch for this assignment:

      :::bash
      $ git checkout -b homework13              # Create homework13 branch and check it out

  ### Task 1: Skeleton Code

  To help you get started, the instructor has provided you with the following [skeleton code]:

      :::bash
      # Go to assignments repository
      $ cd path/to/assignments/repository

      # -----------------------------------------------------
      # MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT INSIDE THE homework13 DIRECTORY
      # -----------------------------------------------------
      # MAKE SURE YOU ARE AT THE TOP-LEVEL DIRECTORY
      # -----------------------------------------------------

      # Download skeleton code tarball
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20312.fa23/static/tar/homework13.tar.gz

      # Extract skeleton code tarball
      $ tar xzvf homework13.tar.gz

  Once downloaded and extracted, you should see the following files in your
  `homework13` directory:

      :::bash
      homework13
          \_ Makefile         # This is the Makefile for building all the assignment artifacts
          \_ flights.py       # This is the Python module for the Flights programming challenge
          \_ passcode.py      # This is the Python script for the Passcode programming challenge
          \_ sim_city.py      # This is the Python script for the Sim City programming challenge

  [skeleton code]: https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20312.fa23/static/tar/homework13.tar.gz

  ### Task 2: Initial Import

  Now that the files are extracted into the `homework13` folder, you can
  **commit** them to your [git] repository:

      :::bash
      # Go into homework13 folder
      $ cd homework13

      # Add and commit initial skeleton files
      $ git add Makefile                            # Mark changes for commit
      $ git add *.py
      $ git commit -m "Homework 13: Initial Import" # Record changes

  ### Task 3: Unit Tests

  After downloading and extracting these files, you can run the `make` command
  to run the tests.

      :::bash
      # Run all tests (will trigger automatic download)
      $ make

  You will notice that the `Makefile` downloads three additional test scripts:

      :::bash
      homework13
        \_ flights_test.py    # This is the Python unit test for the Flights programming challenge
        \_ passcode_test.py   # This is the Python unit test for the Passcode programming challenge
        \_ sim_city_test.py   # This is the Python unit test for the Sim City programming challenge

  In addition to the embedded [doctests] in the [skeleton code], you will be
  using these [unit tests] to verify the correctness and behavior of your code.

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-download"></i> Automatic Downloads

  The `test` scripts are automatically downloaded by the `Makefile`, so any
  modifications you do to them will be lost when you run `make` again.
  Likewise, because they are automatically downloaded, you do not need to `add`
  or `commit` them to your [git] repository.

  </div>

  The details on what you need to implement for this assignment are described
  in the following sections.

  [doctests]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html

  ## Activity 1: Flights (4 Points)

  For the first activity, you are to use [Dijkstra's Algorithm] to solve the
  following **programming challenge**:

  > The semester is finally (almost) done and that means you get to go home! 
  Unfortunately, air travel is a bit chaotic at the moment and [Anthony Travel]
  needs you to help them **plan flights** for students by determining the
  **flight plan** with the **lowest price** from a **origin** city to a
  **destination** city.

  <div class="thumbnail text-center">
    <img src="static/img/homework13-flights.png" class="img-responsive">
  </div>

  > That is, given a series of flights in the form of: `source`, `target`,
  `price`, find the **path** with the lowest overall cost from the **origin**
  to the **destination**.

  Here is an example of `flights.py` executing as a script:

      :::bash
      $ ./flights.py
      0 2 3
      0 1 100
      1 2 50
      0 2 365
      Cost: $150, Plan: 0 -> 1 -> 2

  ### Task 1: `flights.py`

  The `flights.py` [Python] script contains the **functions** you are to
  complete to solve this **programming challenge**:

  1. `read_graph(stream=sys.stdin) -> Optional[tuple[int, int, Graph]]`

      > This function reads an **origin**, a **destination**, and a set of
      **edges** from the `stream`, creates a `Graph` based on the **edges**,
      and returns the **origin**, **destination**, and  `Graph`.  If there is
      no data in the `stream`, then `None` is returned.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
      **Hint**: Use a [defaultdict] to make an [adjacency list] from the `stream`.
      </div>

  2. `find_cheapest_flight_plan(origin: int, destination: int, graph: Graph) -> tuple[int, Plan]`

      > This function uses [Dijkstra's algorithm] to find the flight plan with
      the lowest overall cost from the `origin` to the `destination` and
      returns the lowest cost and the `Plan` (ie. **edges** in the form of a
      [dict] where the `key` is the `target` and the `value` is the `source`).

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Use the **frontier** based traversal algorithm with a [heapq] to
        implement [Dijkstra's algorithm].  Be sure to check if you have reached
        the `destination` and remove the `origin` **self-edge** from the `Plan`
        (ie. `visited` [dict]).

      </div>

  3. `flight_plan(origin: int, destination: int, plan: Plan) -> Iterator[int]`

      > This function **recursively** generates the vertices to visit from
      `origin` to `destination` according to the specified `plan`.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Think carefully about the **base case** for **recursively**
        reconstructing the path from the `origin` to the `destination` and use
        `yield` or `yield from` appropriately.

      </div>

  4. `main(stream=sys.stdin) -> None`

      > This function reads an **origin**, a **destination**, and a set of
      **edges** from the `stream`, creates a `Graph` based on the **edges**,
      finds the cheapest flight `Plan` from the **origin** to the
      **destination**, and then prints out the overall **cost** and **path**
      used in the `Plan`.  This is repeated until the end of the `stream` is
      reached.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Use the [walrus operator] with `read_graph` and the [str.join]
        method as appropriate.

      </div>

  [defaultdict]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict

  [str.join]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> DocTests

  You may notice that in addition to the usual comments and <tt>TODOs</tt>, the
  [docstrings] of each method also contains a few [doctests].

  You are **not** to modify these [doctests] and must keep them in-place.  They
  are used to verify the correctness of your code.

  Your code goes **below** the [docstrings], where the <tt>TODO</tt> and
  <tt>pass</tt> commands are (you may remove the <tt>pass</tt> once you
  complete the method).

  </div>

  [docstrings]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/

  ### Task 2: Testing

  As you implement `flights.py`, you can use the provided [doctests] to verify the
  correctness of your code:

      :::bash
      # Run doctests
      $ python3 -m doctest flights.py -v
      ...
      4 items passed all tests:
         1 tests in flights.find_cheapest_flight_plan
         1 tests in flights.flight_plan
         1 tests in flights.main
         1 tests in flights.read_graph
      4 tests in 5 items.
      4 passed and 0 failed.
      Test passed.

  You can also use `make` to run both the [doctests] and the [unit tests]:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests (and doctests)
      $ make test-flights
      Testing flights ...
      test_00_doctest (__main__.FlightsTests) ... ok
      test_01_mypy (__main__.FlightsTests) ... ok
      test_02_read_graph (__main__.FlightsTests) ... ok
      test_03_find_cheapest_flight_plan (__main__.FlightsTests) ... ok
      test_04_flight_plan (__main__.FlightsTests) ... ok
      test_05_main (__main__.FlightsTests) ... ok

         Score 4.00 / 4.00
        Status Success

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ran 6 tests in 0.048s

      OK

  To just run the [unit tests], you can do the following:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests
      $ ./flights_test.py -v
      ...

  To run a specific [unit test], you can specify the **method name**:

      :::bash
      # Run only mypy unit test
      $ ./flights_test.py -v FlightsTests.test_01_mypy
      ...

  <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-repeat"></i> Iterative Development

  You should practice [iterative development]. That is, rather than writing a
  bunch of code and then debugging it all at once, you should concentrate on
  one function at a time and then test that **one thing at a time**. The provided
  [unit tests] allow you to check on the correctness of the individual functions
  without implementing everything at once. Take advantage of this and build one
  thing at a time.

  ## Activity 2: Sim City (3 Points)

  For the second activity, you are to use [Prim's Algorithm] to solve the
  following **programming challenge**:

  > Recalling your youth, you remember spending long hours playing [Sim City].
  In this game you had the privilege and honor of building a city to your exact
  specifications and desires. You could build airports, sports stadiums,
  schools, industrial factories, residential homes, and more. It was your job
  to keep the citizens of your metropolis happy and prosperous.

  > Unfortunately, to pay for all of these construction projects, you had to
  tax your people. Even in the virtual world, people hate taxes and want you to
  spend their hard-earned income wisely. In particular, they would demand that
  you build roads to connect every building, but in the most cost efficient
  way.

  <div class="thumbnail text-center">
    <img src="static/img/homework13-simcity.png" class="img-responsive">
  </div>

  > Now that you have had some training in [graph] algorithms, you can easily
  tackle the problem of connecting every building in your city to every other
  building using the **minimum amount of road**. Given the coordinates of the
  buildings in a city, you are to connect them such that all buildings are
  reachable by road, while minimizing the amount of pavement you must lay down
  to make the connections.

  > For each set of building locations, output the **minimum total amount of
  road** that must be constructed to connect all the buildings to **two decimal
  places**. 

  Here is an example of `sim_city.py` executing as a script:

      :::bash
      $ ./sim_city.py
      3
      1.0 1.0
      2.0 2.0
      2.0 4.0
      MST: 3.41

  [Sim City]: https://www.ea.com/games/simcity

  ### Task 1: `sim_city.py`

  The `sim_city.py` [Python] script contains the **functions** you are to
  complete to solve this **programming challenge**:

  1. `read_points(stream=sys.stdin) -> Points`

      > This function reads a series of **points** into a [list], while given
      each **point** an **numeric identifier** (ie. the first **point** is `0`,
      the second **point** is `1`, etc.).

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
      **Hints**: Make sure the coordinates are [floats].
      </div>

  2. `build_graph(points: Points) -> Graph`

      > This function constructs a `Graph` (ie. [adjacency list]) from the
      series of **points** and returns it.  The [adjacency list] uses the
      [distance] between each **point** as the **weight** of the **edge**.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hints**: Carefully handle self-edges, and use [math.dist] to compute
        the distance between two **points**.

      </div>

  3. `construct_mst(graph) -> Edges`

      > This function uses [Prim's algorithm] to construct a **minimum spanning
      tree** that connects all the points in the `Graph` with the minimum
      amount of pavement and returns the `Edges` in the resulting [MST].

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Use the **frontier** based traversal algorithm with a [heapq] to
        implement [Prim's algorithm].  Be sure to check if you have reached the
        `destination` and remove the `origin` **self-edge** from the `Edges`
        (ie. `visited` [dict]).

      </div>

  4. `main(stream=sys.stdin) -> None`

      > This function reads in a set of **points** from the `stream`,
      constructs a `Graph`, computes the [MST] of the `Graph`, and then prints
      out the total cost of the **edges** in the resulting [MST]. This is
      repeated until the end of the `stream` is reached.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Use the [walrus operator] with `read_points` and the [sum]
        function on the resulting `Edges` from `construct_mst`.

  ### Task 2: Testing

  As you implement `sim_city.py`, you can use the provided [doctests] to verify
  the correctness of your code:

      :::bash
      # Run doctests
      $ python3 -m doctest sim_city.py -v
      ...
      4 items passed all tests:
         1 tests in sim_city.build_graph
         1 tests in sim_city.construct_mst
         1 tests in sim_city.main
         1 tests in sim_city.read_points
      4 tests in 5 items.
      4 passed and 0 failed.
      Test passed.

  You can also use `make` to run both the [doctests] and the [unit tests]:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests (and doctests)
      $ make test-sim-city
      Testing sim_city ...

      test_05_main (__main__.SimCityTests) ... ok

         Score 3.00 / 3.00
        Status Success

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ran 6 tests in 0.048s

      OK

  To just run the [unit tests], you can do the following:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests
      $ ./sim_city_test.py -v
      ...

  To run a specific [unit test], you can specify the **method name**:

      :::bash
      # Run only mypy unit test
      $ ./sim_city_test.py -v SimCityTests.test_01_mypy
      ...

  ## Activity 3: Passcode (3 Points)

  For the third activity, you are to use [Kahn's Algorithm] to solve the
  following **programming challenge**:

  > Like most high security research facilities, many of the rooms in the
  Cushing and Fitzpatrick require a secret number code to enter. Usually, a
  single passcode is given to all the users of a particular room.
  Unfortunately, in this day and age of camera phones and drones, it is easy
  for intruders to snoop on people entering in the **passcode**.

  > In an effort to thwart passcode snoopers, the building security team has
  implemented a new passcode mechanism: instead of entering the whole passcode,
  the user must enter in three random numbers from the original door code.
  For instance, if the passcode was **2468135**, the user may be asked to
  enter in the **2nd**, **4th**, and **5th** numbers: **481**. This shorter
  sequence (**2nd**, **4th**, **5th**) changes each time, so just watching
  someone enter in the door code will not guarantee entry to the snooper.
  Moreover, it helps prevent divulging the complete passcode.

  <div class="thumbnail text-center">
    <img src="static/img/homework13-passcode.png" class="img-responsive">
  </div>

  > Being the **black hat** that you are, however, you decide that this
  security arrangement is weak and plan on cracking the code to the
  instructor's office.  To do so, you have carefully monitored a series of
  successful entries and recorded them in a text file. Knowing that the three
  random numbers are always asked for in order and that the digits in the
  passcode are unique (due to limitations to the security software), your next
  step is to analyze these entries and produce the original passcode.

  Here is an example of `passcode.py` executing as a script:

      :::bash
      $ ./passcode.py
      352
      154
      542
      315
      152
      31542

  ### Task 1: `passcode.py`

  The `passcode.py` [Python] script contains the **functions** you are to
  complete to solve this **programming challenge**:

  1. `read_graph(stream=sys.stdin) -> Graph`

      > This function reads the short passcode samples from the `stream`,
      constructs an [adjacency set], and returns it.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Draw a picture of the **relationship** between each digit in
      the short passcode samples.

      </div>

  2. `compute_degrees(graph: Graph) -> Degrees`

      > This function computes the **incoming degree** of each **vertex** in
      the `Graph` and returns a [dict] with the **degrees**.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Use a [defaultdict] to store the **degrees**.

      </div>

  3. `find_passcode(graph: Graph) -> list[int]`

      > This function uses [Kahn's algorithm] to perform a [topological sort]
      of the `Graph` and returns [list] of the **vertices** visited.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Use the **frontier** based traversal algorithm with a [deque]
        to implement [Kahn's algorithm].

      </div>

  4. `main(stream=sys.stdin) -> None`

      > This function reads in short passcode samples, finds the original
      passcode, and prints it out.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">

      **Hint**: Use the [str.join] appropriately.

  ## Activity 4: Quiz (2 Points)

  Once you have completed all the activities above, you are to complete the
  following **reflection quiz**:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/homework13.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  As with [Reading 01], you will need to store your answers in a
  `homework13/answers.json` file.  You can use the form above to generate the
  contents of this file, or you can write the [JSON] by hand.

  To check your quiz directly, you can use the `check.py` script:

      :::bash
      $ ../.scripts/check.py
      Checking homework13 quiz ...
            Q1 0.40
            Q2 0.40
            Q3 0.40
            Q4 0.20
            Q5 0.40
            Q6 0.20
         Score 2.00 / 2.00
        Status Success

  ## Leet Point (1 Extra Credit Point)

  For **extra credit**, you are to solve the following [LeetCode] problem in
  [Python].

  > [797. All Paths From Source to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target)

  To receive credit, you must pass on [LeetCode] and achieve an **Accepted**
  submission.

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Verification

  To get credit for this Leet Point, show your solution and the [LeetCode]
  acceptance page to a TA to verify (or attached a screenshot with both to your
  **Pull Request**).  You have up until **two days after** this assignment is
  due to verify your Leet Point.

  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> Self-Service Extension

  Remember that you can always **forgo** this Leet Point for **two extra days**
  to do the homework.  That is, if you need an extension, you can simply skip
  the Leet Point and you will automatically have until Friday to complete the
  assignment for full credit.

  Just leave a note on your **Pull Request** of your intentions.

  #### <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Pull Request

  Remember to create a [Pull Request] and assign the appropriate TA from the
  [Reading 13 TA List].

  **DO NOT MERGE** your own [Pull Request].  The TAs use open [Pull Request]s
  to keep track of which assignments to grade.  Closing them yourself will
  cause a delay in grading and confuse the TAs.
